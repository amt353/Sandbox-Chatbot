# Sandbox-Chatbot
The objective is to create an interactive webpage where my "Sandbox Chatbot" will respond when you talk and play "guess your mood" with you. With the guessing game, the user and chatbot can guess each other's mood.  Correct guesses earn 1 point and incorrect ones grant the opponent 1 point.  The chatbot's "mood" is assigned based on analysis of the user's intent and sentiment.

Although functions and logic are not at a workable state yet, below is the current interface with chat input on the bottom left corner:

## Checkpoint 1 (in progress)
The first bite-sized objective is to set up the general interface (minus chat) and a watered-down "guess your mood" game. The bot will randomly guess your mood, and its mood is randomly assigned.

## Checkpoint 2
The chat interface will be introduced.

## Checkpoint 3
The natural language processing aspect of the chatbot will be incorporated.
