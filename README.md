# Sandbox-Chatbot
The objective is to create an interactive webpage where my "Sandbox Chatbot" will respond when you talk and play "guess your mood" with you. With the guessing game, the user and chatbot can guess each other's mood.  Correct guesses earn 1 point and incorrect ones grant the opponent 1 point.  The chatbot's "mood" assigned based on analysis of the user's intent and sentiment.
